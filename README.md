# bikesharing

### Overview
For this analysis, we have been tasked with creating visualizations for investors for our Bikesharing Service aimed to launch in Des Moines, Iowa. Through the use of a dataset from CitiBike, we imported the data into Tableau, an interactive data visualization software and created visualizations that would aid in our presentation of our proposal for the Bikesharing service. The dataset used is of CitiBike data from August 2019- a time of year in which ridership is undoubtedly high, especially in New York City and will provide a copious amount of beneficial data.

Before certain analyses could be performed, we first had to convert our CSV file's "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Through the use of Jupyter Notebook and Pandas, we created an updated CSV file and imported it to our Tableau workbook to create an imporved visualization.
