### Overview
For this analysis, we have been tasked with creating visualizations for investors for our Bikesharing Service aimed to launch in Des Moines, Iowa. Through the use of a dataset from CitiBike, we imported the data into Tableau, an interactive data visualization software and created visualizations that would aid in our presentation of our proposal for the Bikesharing service. The dataset used is of CitiBike data from August 2019- a time of year in which ridership is undoubtedly high, especially in New York City.
